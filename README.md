The Kaizoyu App is an anime streaming platform¹ exclusive for Android devices. Watch anime for free
without any torrents, web-scraping, or highly compressed online video files.

¹ Although we consider the app to be a streaming platform, it is, in fact, a Kitsu, Nibl.co.uk and XDCC client
combination.

**Keep in mind the app is still in open beta, and any kind of feedback/reports are greatly appreciated.**
**Missing episodes for shows can be reported at our Discord server.**
